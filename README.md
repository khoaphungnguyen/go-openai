# go-openai

Create backend services for SmartChat, powered by OpenAI. This project includes robust user authentication, real-time chat processing, and seamless integration with OpenAI's CHATGPT API. Our primary focus is on scalability, security, and user privacy.

## Key Components

- **User Authentication System**: A robust authentication mechanism to securely identify users.
- **Message Handling Service**: Handles incoming and outgoing messages, interfacing with the OpenAI ChatGPT API.
- **OpenAI ChatGPT API Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with OpenAI's ChatGPT to provide intelligent responses based on user inputs.
- **Message Logging**: Automatically logs both user queries and AI responses for data consistency and auditability.

## Workflow

- **User Sign-In**: Users securely sign in, receiving an authentication token for session management.
- **CORS Handling**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configurations ensure secure interactions between different domains.
- **Message Submission**: Authenticated users send messages, which are first logged and then passed to the OpenAI ChatGPT API.
- **Token Verification**: Each request is verified for authenticity using the user's auth token.
- **Message Processing**: The user's message is processed by OpenAI ChatGPT, generating a contextually relevant response.
- **Response Logging**: The AI-generated response is logged alongside the user's original message.
- **Response Delivery**: The response is streamed back to the user in real-time, providing an interactive experience.
- **Data Storage**: All interactions are stored securely, adhering to privacy and security standards.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a scheduled task for deleting expired user accounts.
- Enhance the user registration process to verify email ownership.
- Develop more robust error handling mechanisms.
- Optimize database queries for improved performance and scalability.

## Conclusion

Our go-openai project represents a significant step towards enhancing user engagement through AI-powered conversations. We are committed to leveraging cutting-edge technology to deliver an innovative, secure, and interactive user experience.
